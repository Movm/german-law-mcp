# German Law MCP Server

<!-- ANSVAR-CTA-BEGIN -->
> **The German law corpus is now served through the Ansvar Gateway.** Connect your AI assistant (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, custom MCP client) to `https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp` — one OAuth connection, free tier available, covering this corpus plus EU regulations, national law across 28 audited jurisdictions, and CVE/security intelligence, every result with a verbatim source citation. Start at https://ansvar.eu/docs/quickstart

### Connect

**Claude Code** (one line):

```bash
claude mcp add ansvar --transport http https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (or `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ansvar": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude.ai** — Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → paste `https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp`

First request opens an OAuth signup flow (setup details: [ansvar.eu/docs/quickstart](https://ansvar.eu/docs/quickstart)). After signup, your client is bound to your account; tier (free / premium / team / company) determines fan-out, quota, and which downstream MCPs are reachable.

## Self-host this MCP

You can also clone this repo and build the corpus yourself. The schema,
fetcher, and tool implementations all live here. What is not in the repo is
the pre-built database — TDM and standards-licensing constraints on the
upstream sources mean we host the corpus on Ansvar infrastructure rather
than redistribute it as a public artifact.

Build your own: run this repo's ingestion script (entry-point varies per
repo — typically `scripts/ingest.sh`, `npm run ingest`, or `make ingest`;
check the repo root).

Query **6,870 German federal statutes** -- from the BGB and StGB to the GG, BDSG, and more -- directly from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client.

If you're building legal tech, compliance tools, or doing German legal research, this is your verified reference database.

Built by [Ansvar Systems](https://ansvar.eu) -- Stockholm, Sweden

## Why This Exists

German legal research is scattered across gesetze-im-internet.de, dejure.org, rechtsprechung-im-internet.de, and DIP Bundestag. Whether you're:
- A **Rechtsanwalt** validating citations in a Schriftsatz or contract
- A **compliance officer** checking if a statute is still in force
- A **legal tech developer** building tools on German law
- A **researcher** tracing legislative history from Drucksache to statute

...you shouldn't need 47 browser tabs and manual PDF cross-referencing. Ask Claude. Get the exact provision. With context.

This MCP server makes German law **searchable, cross-referenceable, and AI-readable**.

---

## Example Queries

Once connected, just ask naturally:

- *"Was sagt § 823 Abs. 1 BGB über Schadensersatz?"*
- *"Ist das BDSG 2018 noch in Kraft?"*
- *"Find provisions about Datenschutz in German law"*
- *"What EU directives does the BDSG implement?"*
- *"Which German laws implement the GDPR?"*
- *"Get the preparatory works for the IT-Sicherheitsgesetz"*
- *"Validate the citation § 433 BGB"*
- *"Search for Kündigungsschutz in case law"*
- *"Compare DSGVO implementation across German statutes"*

---

## What's Included

| Category | Count | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Statutes** | 6,870 laws | Complete German federal legislation |
| **Provisions** | 91,843 sections | Full-text searchable with FTS5 |
| **Case Law** | 5,000 decisions | BVerfG, BGH, BVerwG, BAG, BSG, BFH, BPatG |
| **Preparatory Works** | 89,423 records | Drucksachen + Plenarprotokolle (WP 19 + 20) |
| **Database Size** | ~300 MB | Runtime download on cold start (Strategy B) |
| **Daily Updates** | Automated | Freshness checks against gesetze-im-internet.de |

**Verified data only** -- every provision is ingested from official government sources. Zero LLM-generated content.

---

## See It In Action

### Why This Works

**Verbatim Source Text (No LLM Processing):**
- All statute text is ingested from gesetze-im-internet.de official XML exports
- Provisions are returned **unchanged** from SQLite FTS5 database rows
- Zero LLM summarization or paraphrasing -- the database contains regulation text, not AI interpretations

**Smart Context Management:**
- Search returns ranked provisions with BM25 scoring (safe for context)
- Three-tier search strategy: exact citation match → FTS5 full-text → LIKE fallback
- Cross-references help navigate without loading everything at once

**Technical Architecture:**
```
gesetze-im-internet.de → Parse XML → SQLite → FTS5 snippet() → MCP response
                  ↑                          ↑
           Provision parser           Verbatim database query
```

### Traditional Research vs. This MCP

| Traditional Approach | This MCP Server |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Search gesetze-im-internet.de by law name | Search by plain German: *"Datenschutz Arbeitnehmer"* |
| Navigate multi-section statutes manually | Get the exact provision with context |
| Manual cross-referencing between laws | `build_legal_stance` aggregates across sources |
| "Is this statute still in force?" → check manually | `check_currency` → answer in seconds |
| Find EU basis → dig through EUR-Lex | `get_eu_basis` → linked EU directives instantly |
| Check DIP Bundestag for legislative history | `get_preparatory_works` → structured results |
| No API, no integration | MCP protocol → AI-native |

**Traditional:** Search gesetze-im-internet.de → Download XML → Ctrl+F → Cross-reference with Drucksache → Check EUR-Lex for EU basis → Repeat

**This MCP:** *"What EU law is the basis for § 1 BDSG?"* → Done.

## Development

### Branching Strategy

This repository uses a `dev` integration branch. **Do not push directly to `main`.**

```
feature-branch → PR to dev → verify on dev → PR to main → deploy
```

- `main` is production-ready. Only receives merges from `dev` via PR.
- `dev` is the integration branch. All changes land here first.
- Feature branches are created from `dev`.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ansvar-Systems/German-law-mcp
cd German-law-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev                                       # Start MCP server
npx @anthropic/mcp-inspector node dist/index.js   # Test with MCP Inspector
```

### Data Management

```bash
npm run ingest                    # Ingest statutes from gesetze-im-internet.de
npm run ingest:cases              # Ingest case law from rechtsprechung-im-internet.de
npm run ingest:prep               # Ingest preparatory works from DIP Bundestag
npm run auto-update               # Run full update cycle
npm run auto-update:dry-run       # Preview what would be updated
npm run drift:detect              # Detect schema/data drift
```

### Performance

- **Search Speed:** <100ms for most FTS5 queries
- **Database Size:** ~300 MB (runtime download, Strategy B)
- **Ingestion Coverage:** 6,870/6,870 statutes (100% TOC coverage)

## About Ansvar Systems

We build AI-accelerated compliance and legal research tools for the European market. This MCP server started as our internal reference tool for German law -- turns out everyone building for the DACH market has the same research frustrations.

So we're open-sourcing it. Navigating 6,870 statutes shouldn't require a law degree.
